The `spi_host_init` and `SPI_HOST_INIT` functions are designed to initialize an SPI peripheral with specific configurations.

### Error Checking:

- **SPI_HOST_INIT**: Written in uppercase letters, this version of the function includes compile-time parameter checking to ensure the validity of the provided parameters. The parameters such as `spi_peripheral_num` and `spi_clock_source` are checked against valid definitions at compile time. This safeguard helps detect configuration errors early in the development phase.
  
	- **Usage Note**: Utilize this function only when the parameters are known at compile time.

- **spi_host_init**: This function provides the same SPI initialization capabilities but without the compile-time parameter check. 
  
	- **Usage Note**: Opt for this function when dealing with parameters that might be determined at runtime.

### Parameters:

1. **spi_peripheral_num (const spi_host_inst_t)**: The specific SPI peripheral instance to initialize.
2. **spi_clock_source (const uint32_t)**: The clock source that will be used for configuring the SPI peripheral.
3. **spi_clock_source_freq (const uint32_t)**: The frequency of the clock source in Hertz.
4. **spi_bus_frequency (const unsigned long)**: The desired frequency/baud rate for SPI communication.
5. **spi_extra_configuration_opt (const spi_bus_opt_t)**: Extra configuration options for customizing the SPI host driver.

### Return:

- **uhal_status_t**: The function will return a status indicating the success or failure of the initialization process. The exact definitions of possible return values should be referenced in the "error_checking.h" header file.

### Working:

1. The function begins by validating the provided parameters to ensure they're within acceptable ranges.
2. It configures the clock source for the SPI peripheral based on the `spi_clock_source` parameter.
3. The function sets the clock source frequency and SPI bus frequency as specified.
4. Any additional configurations specified in `spi_extra_configuration_opt` are applied.
5. Finally, the function activates the SPI peripheral, making it ready for communication transactions.

1. The function begins by ensuring that the SPI peripheral is ready for data reception.
2. It then initiates the read operation, which is designed to be non-blocking. The function does not wait for the full completion of data reception; instead, it starts the process and then returns control to the calling program immediately.
3. The function exits quickly after starting the data reception, allowing other operations to proceed concurrently while the SPI peripheral continues to receive data in the background.

## SPI Host IRQ Functionality

The SPI Host driver as part of the Universal HAL includes specific Interrupt Request (IRQ) handlers for managing SPI communication. These handlers are triggered in response to specific actions during SPI transactions. They are declared as weak symbols, allowing for the possibility of overriding them with custom implementations.

### 1. Data Receive IRQ

Activated when a read action is executed by the SPI host. This IRQ handler is essential for processing data received from an SPI slave device.

```c
void spi_host_data_recv_irq(const void *hw, volatile bustransaction_t *transaction) __attribute__((weak));
```

### 2. Data Send IRQ

Triggered when a write action is performed by the SPI host. This IRQ handler is crucial for managing data transmission to an SPI slave device.

```c
void spi_host_data_send_irq(const void *hw, volatile bustransaction_t *transaction) __attribute__((weak));
```

### Use-Case Example:

Consider a scenario where an SPI host (like a microcontroller) is communicating with an SPI slave device (such as a memory chip or sensor).

1. **Data Read Operation**: When the SPI host initiates a read operation to receive data from the slave device, the `spi_host_data_recv_irq` is invoked. This handler can be customized to process and handle the incoming data according to the specific requirements of your application.

2. **Data Write Operation**: Conversely, when the SPI host sends data to the slave device, the `spi_host_data_send_irq` gets triggered. Customizing this handler allows you to control the data transmission process, ensuring that data is sent correctly and efficiently.

By defining custom implementations for these IRQ handlers, developers can tailor the SPI host's response to read and write operations, allowing for more precise control over data handling and communication flow. This level of customization is particularly beneficial in complex systems where standard IRQ behavior may not suffice.

### Important Note:

- Customizing these IRQ handlers can potentially affect the functionality of the standard `spi_host_write` and `spi_host_read` functions provided by the Universal HAL. It's important to ensure that any custom implementation is compatible with the overall SPI communication process and does not inadvertently disrupt standard operations.
